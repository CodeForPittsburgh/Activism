## [What are the best methods for influencing...](#what-are-the-best-methods-for-influencing) 

### Elected Officials
1. Channel
* In person, representing a larger group you're part of
* Going to public hearings, town halls - and you’ll get 3 minutes to talk
* Speech is very important - phone calls!
* Email
* Twitter
* Thinking about who uses which channels
* RESOURCE: [Metafilter Thread about Best Channels](http://ask.metafilter.com/263340/How-to-most-effectivly-communicate-with-elected-representatives)
* RESOURCE: [Indivisible](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/)
2. Issues
* Not knowing the demographics about who IS and ISN’T contacting representatives (whose voices aren’t being heard?)
* Sometimes difficult/inconvenient to call elected officials
* Representatives can easily ignore emails and online petitions
* Some community organizations interface more easily with elected representatives
* How to reach people who aren’t represented in classic organizations
* RESOURCE: [University of Wisconsin-Extension, Cooperative Extension : Tips for Working with Elected and Appointed Officials](http://www.uwex.edu/ces/employeeresources/value/documents/Working%20with%20Elected%20and%20Appointed%20Officials.pdf)
3. Message
* Partisan vs. non-partisan
4. FOIA request for demographic data and topics people called their representatives about
* OR at least zip codes to find the places people are/aren’t calling from 
* To give to advocacy groups to increase/promote increased advocacy
5. Alternative ways to promote 

### Appointed Officials
* Very similar to elected officials, though they sometimes require indirect pressure.

### Citizen Groups
1. Social media presence
* Larger campaigns
* Smaller interactions
* Tweet chats
2. Word of mouth
3. Attend events
* Meetups!
* Whether in support or in protest
* Marching
4. Speaking with $$$
5. Find out who board members are
>“Speaking TO a group vs speaking ABOUT a group. Both are public actions.”

### Corporations
* Boycotts
* Shareholder vote!--buy stock then vote in their elections
* Endorse (Speaking with wallet)
* Price cutting (e.g., CVS is currently buying a different EpiPen like product from company other than Mylan)
* Social Media: public shaming!
* Yelp
* Positive reinforcement for doing the right thing (through any channel)
* Get smaller companies to boycott larger ones they use
* Better Business Bureau
* Court of Law
* Unionization
* Through politicians 
* Billboards, advertisement, etc.
* Customer surveys
* Word of Mouth
* Talking points, scripts
* “Can I speak with your manager”

### Religious Organizations
* Talk to them
* Attend
* Social media
* Find out board members
* Earmark your donation for certain programs
* Write a letter
* Learn; have your religious institution reach out to other religious institutions
* Volunteer

### Non-Profits
* "Advocacy" is the usual term used within the Non-Profit world to talk about employees who advocate on behalf of the non-profit's clients & the larger legal structures that relate to that issue. *i.e. if you want the nonprofit to take an issue to government on your behalf, you go talk to their advocacy department.*
* Usually they do letter-writing, protests, petitions, mobilization
* 501(c3) nonprofits try to keep the amount of time spent on advocacy under 10% (this might be slightly higher). They have to make their primary purpose providing services. But surveying their clients is very time-consuming
* As a result, most non-profits don't have the capacity to do extensive surveys
* If you can talk to the nonprofit's clients on their behalf and get them written down, e.g. doing a survey, this doesn't count as time the nonprofit is spending on advocacy, so you can just hand them the survey results and they can take them to lawmakers.
* They can also use the results: 
  - To improve their service provision
  - For storytelling

### Journalists (“The Fourth Estate”)
* Sara suggests: email them. 
* How to make it interesting to the journalist:
  - Specificity
  - knowing what the journalist already covers. The story should be relevant to their work.
* Earned media: make a lot of noise and they'll come find you (e.g. a protest)
